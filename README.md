# Financial Modules 
The goal of this project is to learn and create a modular monolith using the most recent tech stack. The application consists of a loan system, rich in domain and business rules. 


## Tech Stack 
The tech stack consists of some of the new hot takes of .NET, including: 

- .NET Aspire 
- EF Core 
- MediatR 
- FluentValidation 
- xUnit 
- Postgres
- Redis
- MongoDb
- Docker 
- CI/CD 
- And much more!   

## How I ensure we stay Modular 

Using nugget packages such as NetArchTest.Rules, we can define rules for our architecture, which blocks the build pipeline of the application. With it, we ensure that we stay modular!
